## 🛠 Technologies Used

## 💡 How It Works
- Users interact with the chatbot by placing food orders.
- The chatbot handles queries like "What’s on the menu?" or "I’d like to order a pizza."
- The backend, powered by AWS Lambda, processes the orders and stores them in DynamoDB.
- After the order is processed, the chatbot sends a confirmation message and notifies the user.
